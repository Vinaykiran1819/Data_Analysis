### Overview
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Airbnb listings in Bangkok to prepare it for building a price prediction model. We started by sampling the data to create separate sets for training, testing, and validation. During the exploration phase, we handled missing values, explored data patterns through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, and visualized the data. We then modified the data by standardizing values, transforming data, analyzing outliers, and using principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality. This careful preparation helps in understanding the factors that influence pricing in Airbnb listings and sets the stage for accurate predictive modeling.
