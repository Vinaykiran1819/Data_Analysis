## Overview
This project leveraged PySpark to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) dataset, aiming to unearth important trends and understand the dataset’s characteristics effectively. Using PySpark’s robust data processing features, the project handled the downloading, loading, and preprocessing of the PPP data efficiently, ensuring clean and analysis-ready data. The comprehensive analysis included statistical methods and data visualization techniques to explore loan distributions, identify the most benefited sectors, and assess the geographical spread of loans. The insights gained from this analysis provided a clearer view of how the PPP program has been affecting different sectors and regions.
